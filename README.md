This repository implements a machine learning framework for weak measurement, providing complete code for model training, dataset generation, and pre-trained weights (.pth). To run the code, please initialize a Python 3.10 environment with PyTorch (CUDA 12.1) and standard dependencies like NumPy and Scikit-learn. Due to file size constraints, the full dataset is not uploaded but can be reproduced using the included scripts; for access to the original data or any inquiries, please contact Peng 1056575808@qq.com.
