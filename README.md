This repository implements a machine learning framework for weak measurement using code.py for model training and test.py for result generation. It includes pre-trained model weights for three specific parameters: Best_b.pth (Amplitude), Best_phi.pth (Phase), and Best_zeta.pth (Meta-atom Rotation Angle). The dataset generation is handled by the dataset.nb file (Mathematica), utilizing random seed indices provided in dataset_index.csv and dataset_index_fast_v174.csv. To run the project, please initialize a Python 3.10 environment  with PyTorch (CUDA 12.1) and standard dependencies. For inquiries or access to the full dataset, please contact Peng 1056575808@qq.com.
