This is a weak measurement machine learning model. This contains the code for generating the model and the code for generating the dataset, the dataset's CSV file, and the resulting model's PTH file. 
This is the code for environment installation:
`conda create -n phys_ai python=3.10 -y`
`conda activate phys_ai`
`pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121`
`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`.

The dataset is too large to upload, but it can be generated from a dataset file. Please contact me if you need the dataset.
